The idea is that they provide a discrete and unobtrusive distraction for kids with learning disabilities that gives them something to do with their hands. \r\n\r\n**Thanks to the Reddit [/r/EDC](https://reddit.com/r/EDC) community for the idea and modeling help.**\r\n\r\n### How to\r\nDownload the 3d models you would like to use from [here](/models).\r\nConnect your 3d printer and print the model. From my experience, the higher the resolution on the printout the better it will turn out. I also suggest enabling rafts. \r\nThe bearings used are standard skateboard bearings which can be purchased cheaply on Amazon or eBay. \r\nTo put the spinner together, place it on a hard surface, line up the bearing with the circle on the spinner and tap it in using a rubber mallet. \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIf you have a spinner design that you would like to add to the project, just clone the repo, upload it and submit a pull request.
