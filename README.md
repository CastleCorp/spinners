# Spinners

### About
These 3d printable spinners are fidget toys designed to fit in a pocket. The idea is that they provide a discrete and unobtrusive distraction for kids with learning disabilities that gives them something to do with their hands. 

**Thanks to the Reddit [/r/EDC](https://reddit.com/r/EDC) community for the idea and modeling help.**

### How to
Download the 3d models you would like to use from [here](/models).
Connect your 3d printer and print the model. From my experience, the higher the resolution on the printout the better it will turn out. I also suggest enabling rafts. 
The bearings used are standard skateboard bearings which can be purchased cheaply on Amazon or eBay. 
To put the spinner together, place it on a hard surface, line up the bearing with the circle on the spinner and tap it in using a rubber mallet.
